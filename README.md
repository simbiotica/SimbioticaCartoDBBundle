SimbioticaCartoBundle
=======================

Carto SQL API integration for Symfony2

You can find documentation in Resources/docs folder


## Prerequisites

This version of the bundle has been tested with Symfony 2.3+ and PHP 5.4. 
It should work on Symfony 2.2+ and PHP 5.3+, but was not tested or developed with
backwards compatibility in mind. If you find something that doesn't work, feel
free to submit a PR. I'll try and keep compatibility with Symfony 2.2 and PHP 5.3
based on feedback.
